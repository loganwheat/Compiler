Project Assignment 1

hello

All of the necessary source code is included in the included file.

Make sure that grammar.jflex, LexerTest.java, tokens.cup, testFile.txt, and Makefile are in the same directory as java-cup-11b.jar, java-cup-11b-runtime.jar, and
jflex-1.8.2 for the Makefile to work properly.

This code was written and compiled using openjdk version "11.0.7", so if you are having issues, try installing the proper OpenJDK version.

The code references testFile.txt and outputs both to console and testFile-output.txt; therefore,
insert whatever text you wish to test in testFile.txt

Once the above has been confirmed, you can run the code using the Makefile.

"$make" should work

"$make run" also works

"$make clean" can be called to remove some unnecessary files


The three test files for the project and their test results are in directory testResults.
